4. Contract Libraries (.sol files) are included in the repository, under the folder named "SKALE contract". Note that Thirdweb don't have a straightforward download contract functionality, thus the libraries had to be copied manually as they are exposed in the Thirdweb dashboard - they may not reflect their actual folder hierarchy if any does exist - there were 2 versions of "Address.sol", we had to isolate one version into a another folder ("OpenZeppelin") to keep the same name.
